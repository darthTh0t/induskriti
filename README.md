#### an ecommerce webapp made with **flask** and **alpine JS**

My first full stack webapp, *flask* was selected for its ease in whirring up webpages
*alpineJS* is used due to its simplicity as compared to other frontend libraries like `reactJS`

### Usage of firebase-admin SDK

I have added **firebase-admin** SDK as I want to store images in buckets rather than increase the size of the app
by adding it to the existing filesystem. Due to its small nature, I can upload and remove images remotely without
hassling directly in the `firebase-console`
